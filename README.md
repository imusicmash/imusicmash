### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is Al. I'm a product manager.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Zoominfo's Go-To-Market Intelligence Platform
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AI Agents
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been a data-products focused product manager for some time. I also spent 6 years as a data scientist
- ðŸ’» I'm fairly adept at coding with Python, R, Java, Javascript, or SQL
- ðŸ’¡ I'm enjoying innovating with modern AI and ML
- âš¡ Fun fact 2: The name _imusicmash_ was the name of an iPhone & Android web app I wrote in ~2008, a mashup of my iTunes library, Youtube, concert info, and lyrics. It was fun inventing with the iPhone at the time, just like it's fun inventing with AI today.
